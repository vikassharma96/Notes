xml and activity linked through a process called layout inflamation it triggers when activity starts. During Layout Inflamation
the view defined in xml files are turned or inflated in to kolin view object activity can then draw this onscreen and also
dynamically modify them

<LinearLayout>                         Layout Inflamation
  <ImageView                               // var diceImage: ImageView 
     layout_gravity= "center_horizontal"
     ...>                                      kotlin view object          then activity draw it on screen                         
  </ImageView>                                                                      LinearLayout
  <Button                                  // var roll:Button                           /\
     android:text= "Roll"                                                      ImageView  Button
     id="+@id/roll_Button"                R Class
     ...>                            id roll_button = 0x7fx700
  </Buttin> 
<LinearLayout>
every time we define id for view in xml android studio automatically create integer constant in R class then we can find it with
finViewById() whic search through the hierarcy and find view for us

class MainActivity : AppCompatActivity() { 
     override fun onCreate(savedInstanceState: Bundle?){
              super.onCreate(savedInstanceState)
              setContentView(R.layout.activity_main) // tell which layout is associated with activity
     }
}
MainActivity extends AppCompatActivity which is subclass of android that gives us access to modern android fetures while 
providing backward compatibility with older version of android
Activity do not use constructor for their setup instead series of predefined method are called as part of setup one for eg is
onCreate() method.

<activity android:name=".MainActivity">
    <intent-filter>
        <action android:name="android.intent.action.MAIN" />
        <category android:name="android.intent.category.LAUNCHER" /> // they specify which activity to run first
    </intent-filter>
</activity>

ViewGroup are responsible for holding multiple views on screen and helping to specify their postiton. 
eg - LinearLayout, RelativeLayout, ConstraintLayout, Scrollview e.t.c

Context Object allows us to communicate with and get information about current state of android operating system.
Activity is a subclass of Context so we can use this for context required in Toast
      Toast.makeText(this, "button clicked", Toast.LENGTH_SHORT).show()
      
Gradle is the build tool for android Gradle Andorid Build Tool
- what device run your app
- compile to executable
- dependency management
- signing app to play store
- automated tests

when we click on run a series of gradle command compile your source code through dependency and any associated resource into a
android application package(.apk) - resource, compiled code, androidmanifest, othres
APK file executable format for distributing android applications
their are two build file 
build.gradle(Project)
build.gradle(Module:app) - a module is folder with source file and resources for discreate piece of functionality for our app
Repository in gradle is an remote server where external code is downloaded from 
repository {
    google()
    jcenter()
}
Dependency in gradle is external code libraries, that a project depends on
these plugins are needed by gradle to know how to build android and kotlin project
apply plugin: 'com.android.application'
apply plugin: 'kotlin-android'
apply plugin: 'kotlin-android-extensions'

application id is the unique identifier for both android and google play used to identify it. It not possible to install to
apps with same application id on android and similarly to publish on google play
applicationId "com.teckudos.devappswithkotlin" 

vectorDrawable can scale without lossing quality
vector drawable support in api level 21 and + in lower api level gradle genrate png files which takes space 
to support it with minimum api level there is androix comatible library to api level 7
vectorDrawables.useSupportLibrary = true add to build gradle
correct layout namespace and replace src to srcCompat

Density Independent pixel (dp)
1dp = 1pixels on 160dpi screen
1dp = 3pixels on 480dpi screen
Scale independent pixel (sp)
it is like dp unit but not only scaled by pixel density but also by font size preference that user can set in font settings

<style name="GreenText" parent="@android:style/TextAppearance">
    <item name="android:textColor">#00FF00</item>
</style>

below style with backward comaptibility upto api level 14 so there is Appcompat added
<style name="GreenText" parent="TextAppearance.AppCompat">
    <item name="android:textColor">#00FF00</item>
</style>

similarly we can apply theme 

dark theme - 
<manifest ... >
    <application android:theme="@style/Theme.AppCompat" ... >
    </application>
</manifest>
light theme - 
<manifest ... >
    <application ... >
        <activity android:theme="@style/Theme.AppCompat.Light" ... >
        </activity>
    </application>
</manifest>
Beginning with Android 5.0 (API level 21) and Android Support Library v22.1, you can also specify the android:theme attribute 
to a view in your layout file. This modifies the theme for that view and any child views, which is useful for altering theme 
color palettes in a specific portion of your interface.

Dynamic string
<string name="my_xml_string">My sister %1$s is %2$d years old.</string>
String myString = "Mary"; int myInt = 12;
String formatted = getString(R.string.my_xml_string, myString, myInt);

Data binding - 
with findviewbyid getting reference system or android has to search hierarchy for us and find view at runtime for deep view
it will take time and slow down to avoid this we have technique or pattern called databinding.
which allows us to connect a layout to activity or fragment at compile time. compiler creates an helper class called binding 
class when activity created then we can access view through this generated binding class
The big idea about data binding is to create an object that connects/maps/binds two pieces of distant information 
together at compile time, so that you don't have to look for it at runtime.
The object that surfaces these bindings to you is called the Binding object. It is created by the compiler

<LinearLayout>
 <TextView
 id="+@id/text"
 .....>
 </TextView>                  Binding Object                         binding.text      
 <ImageView                   or binding class                       binding.image
 id="+@id/image">                 
 </ImageView>
<LinearLayout>
